## How can we prove that fish was what it said it was?

We put it in a blender to get it's DNA [https://github.com/rltillett/notes-and-things/blob/master/Curious_DNA_cbess.md](https://github.com/rltillett/notes-and-things/blob/master/Curious_DNA_cbess.md)

Via the Oxford Nanopore device, I obtained these results (report): [https://github.com/rltillett/notes-and-things/blob/master/fishy.pdf](https://github.com/rltillett/notes-and-things/blob/master/fishy.pdf)

Here's just one of the sequences that came off of the Nanopore, and I think it might be useful... [https://github.com/rltillett/notes-and-things/blob/master/a_long_nanopore_sequence.fasta](https://github.com/rltillett/notes-and-things/blob/master/a_long_nanopore_sequence.fasta)
