DNA is fascinating. DNA has stories to tell. DNA contains mysteries. And we are entering an age where those mysteries can be revealed.




## It all started at Whole Foods...

I was shopping at Whole Foods the other day, because somebody had told me that they had an amazing variety of fish that couldn't be found at any other grocer. At first glance, certainly, they weren't wrong.

I saw a fish for sale that I had never seen at a store before.

### _What is this?_

* [Whole Foods's product page is very unhelpful](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/rockfish-fillet-808df2)
* [Google says this: https://lmgtfy.com/?q=rockfish&s=g](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=rockfish&s=g)
* [But when we consult the wiki, there's trouble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockfish)


### But it gets worse
* [Can we trust any fishmonger?](https://youtu.be/HjJQaGYd4Aw)

### Is there a way out?
* How do people prove a fish's identity?
* Can they or we tell by a fillet?
* What about the _____?

## Modifying the DNA necklace method for state-of-the-art DNA Sequencing
* Concentrate the DNA
* Remove the salt
* Wash it some more
* Resuspend it
* Modify the DNA to work with the device
* Cross fingers
