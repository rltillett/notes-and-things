# A Curious DNA Puzzle

DNA is fascinating. DNA has stories to tell. DNA contains mysteries. And we are entering an age where those mysteries can be revealed.

## It all started at Whole Foods...

I was shopping at Whole Foods the other day, because somebody had told me that they had an amazing variety of fish that couldn't be found at any other grocer. At first glance, certainly, they weren't wrong.

I saw a fish for sale that I had never seen at a store before. This one.

### _So, what is this thing?_

* [Whole Foods's product page is very unhelpful](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/rockfish-fillet-808df2)
* [Google says this: https://lmgtfy.com/?q=rockfish&s=g](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=rockfish&s=g)
* [But when we consult the wiki, there's trouble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockfish)


### But it gets worse
* [Can we trust any fishmonger?](https://youtu.be/HjJQaGYd4Aw)

### Is there a way out?
* How do people prove a fish's identity?
* Can they or we tell by a fillet?
* What about the _____?

## Sequencing DNA
* [the first 40 years in 4 minutes](https://youtu.be/u1NJABmmIFE)
* [We now have a democratizing, pretty cool device: the MinION](https://youtu.be/Wq35ZXyayuU)


## More on the MinION

* [First a bit more marketing fluff](https://nanoporetech.com/how-it-works)
* [It can be used in some pretty extreme and difficult locations](https://youtu.be/6RRSxWtJPUw)
* So can we use it in the classroom?
	- [The folks at Sanger have!](https://youtu.be/sXzHKUMXXRo?t=763)


## The main plan is

Absolutely determine the species of this "rockfish" by its DNA truth

**But you should know, this might not work today**

_presenter's note: ask students why it might not work before scrolling further_

### Risks of failure

- DNA may not be intact in this guy/gal
- Muscle may not be as easy to break up as cheek with this kit
- May not get a ribbon of DNA to fish out
- Quantity may be too high or too low
- DNA may be too dirty to work





## A backup plan (it is kind of morbid, though)

- Sequence my own cheek cells, but what would we be searching for?
- Maybe we could ask "is JR going to die a premature death by some already known and already mapped metabolic syndrome"

Which of the possible problems might also happen in this backup plan?


## A second backup (a control DNA sample)

- the MinION kit comes with a control sample
	- of known origin and quantity
	- it's [lambda phage (a virus that parasatises bacteria)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283682905460?via%3Dihub)
	- Fred Sanger sequenced it in 1982 (I was 1 year old)


## Method

Let's modify the DNA necklace method to try to generate samples compatible with the MinION


* Concentrate the DNA (isopropyl alcohol)
* Remove the salt (ethanol)
* Dry it
* Resuspend it (fish-tank buffer)
* Take a small amount for modification
* Modify the DNA with the transposase reagent
* Cross fingers
* Load it up
* Analyze it together next Friday 7/19

Now, to the ELMO:
